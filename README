How to import project to Eclipse and build it
----------------------------------------------

1. Simply import project to your workspace (File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace)
2. Create Debug and Release folders in the project.
3. Press Shift + F9 (Project -> Make Target -> Build) and select the build target (CMake Debug or CMake Release). You can of course build both targets.
